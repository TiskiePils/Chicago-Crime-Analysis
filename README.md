This Repository includes a ipynb file of the Google Colab notebook that was used throughout my analytical data mining project regarding Chicagos crime.

When observing the google colab notebook it should be taken into consideration that this notebook uses an API Endpoint in which if the code is ran, it will update to the most recent reports.
Running the code can take anywhere from 5-10 minutes as this deals with a large amount of data that is needing to be processed. 

Parameters have been set to where the data reaches proposed date start, and will update into the present category. However, if the data file is too large, there is a possible error that can pop up. 

All notations and summary of findings will be found inside the Google Colab notebook with explanation of code, summary, and other informatics that can help readers understand what they will looking into.

Any requests or ideas that come from readings, pleasae feel free to message me with any concerns and ideas that can be placed into this project.

Thank you for taking the time to read over my finidngs and analytical skillset and I hope you enjoy :)
